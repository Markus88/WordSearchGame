# A word search game

Todo:
- Setup an architecture
- The button 'Snyd' was added last minute and has no error handling nor is it disabled when it should be. It causes errors if pressed in the wrong time.
- Move paint section out of 'GameBoard' since it clutters and has to much logic for view code.
- Code cleanup
- And more.
