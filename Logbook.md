Log 04-01-2022: Got home late from work today and general a scarce week with available spare time for this assignment. But i created an empty .NET 6 Winforms project and added gitignore files + read up on Word Search games on wikipedia.

Log 06-01-2022: Started with the real coding today. Found a few ideas and a helper class for the actual game engine. I have properly used around 3 hours today, to make the engine and frontend work as intended. But i will fine tune a little tomorrow, since this exercise caught my attention. It has been fun so far :)
